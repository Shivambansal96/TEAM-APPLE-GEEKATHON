# AirPods Clone Project :
		This project is a clone of Apple's AirPods section(www.apple.com/in/airpods/), created using HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview :
		This project is a front-end web development exercise aimed at replicating the design and layout of Apple's AirPods section on their official website. The goal was to enhance my HTML and CSS skills by recreating a visually appealing and responsive webpage.

	   The cloned page includes key elements such as product images, descriptions, and pricing details, all styled to closely resemble the original AirPods page. To add an interactive touch, I incorporated subtle animations and utilized Font Awesome for consistent and attractive icons.

## Technologies Used :
      In this project I have used many tags of HTML some of the main tags are mantioned below:- 
         1. <meta>
         2. <title>
         3. <link> 
         4. <nav>
         5. <section> 
         6. <video>
         7. <img>
         8. <h1>, <h2>, <h3>
         9. <p>
         10. <a>
         11. <button>
         12. <hr>
         13. <footer>
         14<span>
         15. <script>

      The tags which are used in CSS are as follows:-
         1. margin
         2. padding
         3. font-family
         4. font-size
         5. font-weight
         6. object-fit
         7. background-color
         8. display : block, inline, flex
         9. position: relative, absolute, fixed
         10. justify-content
         11. overflow
         12. opacity
         13. letter-spacing
