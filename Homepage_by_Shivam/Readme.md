# Apple Page Clone Project :
This project is a clone of Apple UI section(https://shivambansal96.github.io/TEAM-APPLE-GEEKATHON/Homepage%20by%20Shivam/), created using HTML and CSS Only.

## Project Overview :
This project is a front-end web development exercise aimed at replicating the design and layout of Apple's Homepage on their official website. The goal was to enhance my HTML and CSS skills by recreating a visually appealing and responsive webpage.

The cloned page includes key elements such as product images, descriptions, and pricing details, all styled to closely resemble the original AirPods page. To add an interactive touch, I incorporated subtle animations and utilized Font Awesome for consistent and attractive icons.
